# Configuration

Before you run the service you must install dependencies by running either ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` in the ```app``` directory.

Then you have to copy the ```app/config/index.js.dist``` file to ```app/config/index.js```, this will allow you to customize the config without versioning it. 

*(Default parameters are suited for Docker, don't change them if you run the service via docker-compose.)*
